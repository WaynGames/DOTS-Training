# Part 2: Path Following

## Concepts Introduced

* **Dynamic Buffer:** A resizable buffer attached to an entity, used to store a variable-length list of data elements in ECS. Dynamic buffers allow us to give an entity an array-like container for related data (e.g. a series of waypoints) that can grow or shrink at runtime.
* **IBufferElementData:** An interface marking a struct type as an element in a dynamic buffer. Each element in a dynamic buffer must implement `IBufferElementData` to be recognized by ECS. This defines the data layout for one entry of the buffer (for example, a waypoint position).
* **Internal Buffer Capacity:** An attribute that sets how many buffer elements are stored **inside** an entity’s chunk before the buffer “overflows” into heap memory. By tuning `[InternalBufferCapacity]`, you can optimize memory layout. Setting it to 0 means no elements are stored in-chunk, so all elements go to heap memory – useful when the list size can be large or varies widely.
* **Local Transform:** The ECS component (`Unity.Transforms.LocalTransform`) that represents an entity’s position, rotation, and scale in local space. In Unity ECS 1.0, `LocalTransform` replaces separate Translation/Rotation components. It works together with `LocalToWorld` (which is provided automatically when using certain transform flags) to determine an entity’s world position.
* **Transform Usage Flags:** A configuration passed to `GetEntity` in bakers to specify what transform components an entity needs. For example, using `TransformUsageFlags.Dynamic` ensures the entity has both a `LocalTransform` (for movement/manipulation) and a `LocalToWorld` (for rendering in the world) on creation. These flags help the baking pipeline include the right transform components for our use case.
* **Burst:** A compiler technology in Unity DOTS that optimizes job and system code for performance. By adding Burst compilation to our ECS systems (or jobs), we can greatly speed up math-heavy code (like moving many entities) and reduce overhead. In Part 2, we use Burst to compile the path-following logic, resulting in faster execution and showcasing the performance benefits via the Unity Profiler.
* **Profiler:** The Unity Profiler is a tool to analyze and measure the performance of your game, including ECS systems. In this part, we use the Profiler to observe the performance of our path-following system, especially to compare the impact of Burst. We can place profiling markers (e.g. `Profiler.BeginSample`) around critical code sections or simply use the Profiler window to see system update times, verifying that our Burst-compiled system runs efficiently.
* **Baking Dependency:** A way to inform the conversion (baking) system that an entity’s baked data depends on some external asset or object. By declaring a dependency (using `DependsOn` in a baker), we ensure the entity will be re-baked if that dependent asset changes. In our case, we mark that the entity’s baking depends on a ScriptableObject (movement speed data). If the designer tweaks that ScriptableObject’s value, the baking system knows to recook the entity so the latest data is used.
* **Baking-Only Entity:** An entity that exists only during the baking process and is not present at runtime. This is typically used for helper or intermediate data that you don’t want to carry into the running game. Unity provides a `BakingOnlyEntity` tag component (and an Authoring component to mark objects as such) which, when added, causes the entity to be stripped out before entering play mode. In this project, we leverage this concept for any temporary entities or conversion-only GameObjects (like waypoint markers) so they do not consume runtime memory or logic once their data has been baked into other entities.
* **Cleaner Code Patterns:** As a bonus, this part introduces a cleaner workflow for authoring and baking code. We encapsulate the baking logic inside the MonoBehaviour authoring class as an inner `Baker` class. This keeps our conversion code close to the authoring component definition and avoids cluttering our project with many small separate baker scripts. It’s an example of organizing ECS code for clarity – using partial classes or nested classes to group related functionality.

## Code Walkthrough

### Authoring the Path and Baker Conversion

In Part 2, we set up a **PathFollowAuthoring** MonoBehaviour that holds the data needed for an enemy to follow a path. This authoring component has two important fields: a **Movement Speed** (referenced via a `ScriptableObject`) and a list of **Waypoints** (Transforms) defining the path. At conversion time, our Baker will read these and add the corresponding ECS components to the entity.

The `PathFollowAuthoring` class is accompanied by an inner baker class (named `EnemyBaker`) that extends `Baker<PathFollowAuthoring>`. In the `Bake` method, we obtain an entity for the authoring GameObject and specify that it needs dynamic transform capabilities:

```csharp
--8<-- "2-PathFollow/Authoring/PathFollowAuthoring.cs:419-427"
var bakingEntity = GetEntity(TransformUsageFlags.Dynamic);
--8<-- "2-PathFollow/Authoring/PathFollowAuthoring.cs:449-457"
if (authoring.PathToFollow.Count > 0)
{
    DynamicBuffer<Waypoints> pathBuffer = AddBuffer<Waypoints>(bakingEntity);
    foreach (Transform waypoint in authoring.PathToFollow)
    {
        pathBuffer.Add(new Waypoints() { Value = waypoint.position });
    }
}
```

Next, we handle the **waypoints**. We add a dynamic buffer of type `Waypoints` and populate it with each waypoint’s position, storing them as buffer elements on the entity.

The `Waypoints` struct is defined as an `IBufferElementData`:

```csharp
--8<-- "2-PathFollow/Components/Waypoints.cs:800-809"
[InternalBufferCapacity(0)]
public struct Waypoints : IBufferElementData
{
    public float3 Value;
}
```

By setting `[InternalBufferCapacity(0)]`, we force all waypoint data to reside in heap memory, avoiding chunk bloat when paths have many points.

After populating the path buffer, we add two more components:

```csharp
--8<-- "2-PathFollow/Authoring/PathFollowAuthoring.cs:522-531"
Speed speed = default;
speed.value = authoring.MovementSpeed.Speed;
AddComponent(bakingEntity, speed);

--8<-- "2-PathFollow/Authoring/PathFollowAuthoring.cs:561-570"
NextPathIndex nextPathIndex = default;
nextPathIndex.value = 0;
AddComponent(bakingEntity, nextPathIndex);
```

* `Speed` holds the movement speed value from a ScriptableObject.
* `NextPathIndex` tracks which waypoint the entity moves toward next, initialized to 0.

We also declare a baking dependency:

```csharp
--8<-- "2-PathFollow/Authoring/PathFollowAuthoring.cs:545-553"
DependsOn(authoring.MovementSpeed);
```

This ensures the entity re-bakes if the `MovementSpeed` asset changes.

Finally, any auxiliary authoring entities (like waypoint markers) can be tagged as baking-only so they are stripped out at runtime, leaving only the main entity with its dynamic buffer and necessary components.

### Movement System: Following the Path

The **PathFollowSystem** moves entities along their waypoints at runtime. Implemented as a `SystemBase` with Burst:

```csharp
--8<-- "2-PathFollow/Systems/PathFollowSystem.cs:10-33"
[BurstCompile]
protected override void OnUpdate()
{
    float deltaTime = Time.DeltaTime;
    Entities
      .WithBurst()
      .ForEach((ref LocalTransform localTransform,
                ref NextPathIndex nextPathIndex,
                in DynamicBuffer<Waypoints> pathBuffer,
                in Speed speed) =>
    {
        if (nextPathIndex.value < pathBuffer.Length)
        {
            float3 currentPos = localTransform.Position;
            float3 targetPos = pathBuffer[nextPathIndex.value].Value;
            float3 direction = targetPos - currentPos;
            float distSquared = math.lengthsq(direction);

            if (distSquared < 0.0001f)
            {
                localTransform.Position = targetPos;
                nextPathIndex.value++;
            }
            else
            {
                float dist = math.sqrt(distSquared);
                float step = speed.value * deltaTime;
                if (step >= dist)
                {
                    localTransform.Position = targetPos;
                    nextPathIndex.value++;
                }
                else
                {
                    float3 move = math.normalize(direction) * step;
                    localTransform.Position += move;
                }
            }
        }
    }).ScheduleParallel();
}
```

This loop:

1. Reads each entity’s `LocalTransform`, `NextPathIndex`, `Waypoints` buffer, and `Speed`.
2. Calculates direction and distance to the next waypoint.
3. Moves toward the waypoint, snapping and advancing the index when reached.
4. Schedules as a Burst-compiled parallel job for high performance.

By the end, entities follow their paths, stopping when all waypoints are consumed.

## Summary of Learning Objectives

In Part 2, you learned to:

1. Define `IBufferElementData` and attach **Dynamic Buffers** to entities for variable-length data (waypoints).
2. Tune **InternalBufferCapacity** to control memory layout of buffers.
3. Convert scene authoring data (waypoint Transforms, ScriptableObject speed) into ECS components via a **nested Baker** class.
4. Declare **baking dependencies** to keep entity data in sync with assets.
5. Implement a **Burst-compiled** `PathFollowSystem` that reads buffers and transforms to move entities along a path.
6. Use **ScheduleParallel** for multi-threaded execution and observe performance via the Unity Profiler.
7. Strip authoring-only entities with **BakingOnly** to minimize runtime entity count.
8. Organize ECS code with cleaner authoring/baking patterns.

By mastering these concepts, you can efficiently implement path-following behavior in DOTS for many entities simultaneously.

## Preview of Part 3: Spawning

In **Part 3: Spawning**, we’ll learn to dynamically create entities at runtime using the **Entity Command Buffer**. You’ll see how to:

* Convert Unity prefab GameObjects into **entity prefabs**.
* Use the command buffer (`EntityCommandBuffer`) to safely instantiate entities in jobs and systems.
* Tag and filter entities with **marker components** (empty `IComponentData`) to identify groups like “enemies.”
* Control system execution order with **UpdateBefore/UpdateAfter** and **RequireForUpdate**.
* Spawn waves of enemies that automatically follow paths defined in Part 2.

Get ready to dive into runtime entity creation and management, laying the groundwork for interactive gameplay in your DOTS-based tower defense project!
